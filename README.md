## AuctionGym

This repository contains the source code for AuctionGym: a simulation environment that enables reproducible offline evaluation of bandit and reinforcement learning approaches to ad allocation and bidding in online advertising auctions.
A research paper accompanying this repository was accepted as a contribution to the [AdKDD '22 workshop](https://www.adkdd.org/).

TODO: Short motivation as to why this is useful (where do other methods fall short?)

TODO: Short introduction on getting started. Ideally we'll have a notebook that gives a run-through with some nice plots.
